# Lab 05. Programming Language Theory

Laboratory created by Mateusz Ślażyński for "Programming Language Theory" course at AGH University of Science and Technology in Kraków.

This class concerns so-called Algebraic Data Types.

The "TAPL book" referenced in the source code can be found [here](https://github.com/MPRI/M2-4-2/blob/master/Types%20and%20Programming%20Languages.pdf).

## Lab Instructions

Fill files according to the 'TODO:' comments:
- `src/semantics/evaluator.py` (and `src/semantics/term_utils.py`)
- `src/semantics/typechecker.py` (and `src/semantics/type_utils.py`)

## Setup 

* [ ] Make sure, you have a **private** group 
  * [how to create a group](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/#create-a-group)
* [ ] Fork this project into your private group

## How To Submit Solutions

* [ ] Clone repository: git clone:

    git clone <repository url>
    ```
* [ ] Solve the exercises 
    * use MiniZincIDE, whatever
* [ ] Commit your changes
    ```bash

    git commit -m <commit message>
    ```
* [ ] Push changes to the gitlab master branch
    ```bash
    git push -u origin master
    ```

The rest will be taken care of automatically. You can check the `GRADE.md` file for your grade / test results. Be aware that it may take some time (up to one hour) till this file appears / gets updated.
