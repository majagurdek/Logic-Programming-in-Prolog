Dear Student,

I'm happy to announce that you've managed to get **10** out of 15 points for this assignment.
<details><summary>You have already managed to pass 10 tests, so that is encouraging!</summary>&emsp;☑&nbsp;[1p]&nbsp;remove_element<br>&emsp;☑&nbsp;[1p]&nbsp;split<br>&emsp;☑&nbsp;[1p]&nbsp;cut_off_left<br>&emsp;☑&nbsp;[1p]&nbsp;contains_list<br>&emsp;☑&nbsp;[1p]&nbsp;palindrome<br>&emsp;☑&nbsp;[1p]&nbsp;add_element<br>&emsp;☑&nbsp;[1p]&nbsp;cut_off_right<br>&emsp;☑&nbsp;[1p]&nbsp;permutation<br>&emsp;☑&nbsp;[1p]&nbsp;sublist<br>&emsp;☑&nbsp;[1p]&nbsp;remove_all_occurrences</details>

There still exist some issues that should be addressed before the deadline: **2023-11-16 08:00:00 CET (+0100)**. For further details, please refer to the following list:

<details><summary>[1p] flat_list &gt;&gt; the predicate does not flatten the nested lists correctly</summary></details>
<details><summary>[2p] length_diff &gt;&gt; predicate doesn&#x27;t return the difference list length</summary></details>
<details><summary>[2p] length_diff &gt;&gt; the predicate uses unnecessary / forbidden predicates: fail. Try to solve the assignment without them.</summary></details>
<details><summary>[2p] member_diff &gt;&gt; predicate omits some elements in the diff list (maybe duplicates are the problem?)</summary></details>
<details><summary>[2p] member_diff &gt;&gt; predicate is unable to check whether an element belongs to the diff list</summary></details>
<details><summary>[2p] member_diff &gt;&gt; the predicate uses unnecessary / forbidden predicates: fail. Try to solve the assignment without them.</summary></details>
