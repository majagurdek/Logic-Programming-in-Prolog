# Lab 02. Side Effects and Arithmetics 

The goal of this class is to go beyond logic and see the more "programming-like" underbelly of Prolog.

## Notebooks

The instructions here are presented via SWISH â€” a Jupyter like literate programming environment. 
Just follow the two links and play with the interface :)
