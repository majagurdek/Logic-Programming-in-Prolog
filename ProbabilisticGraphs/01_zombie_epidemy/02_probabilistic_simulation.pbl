% TODO:
% define probabilistic simulation model of the epidemy,
% - probabilities stay as in the relational model
% - bobot will use 02_query.que query and evidence.evi evidence
% tip 1. if somebody was infected in time T, they stay infected in time T+1
% tip 2. in prolog one has to use `is` for arithmetic operation, i.e. `BT is T - 1'
