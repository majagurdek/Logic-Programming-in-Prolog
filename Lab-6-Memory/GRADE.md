Dear Student,

I'm happy to announce that you've managed to get **13** out of 16 points for this assignment.\
There still exist some issues that should be addressed before the deadline: 2023-01-11 11:15:00 CET (+0100). For further details, please refer to the following list:

<details><summary>Evaluator should first evaluate address before assigning &gt;&gt; raised exception: TmDereference.__init__() takes 3 positional arguments but 4 were given</summary>* program state '(ref 0 := succ 0 | {})'</details>
<details><summary>Evaluator should evaluate new value just before assigning &gt;&gt; raised exception: TmDereference.__init__() takes 3 positional arguments but 4 were given</summary>* program state '(@0 := pred 0 | {@0 <- succ 0})'</details>
<details><summary>Typecheck should pass correct assignments &gt;&gt; typechecker should find type Unit, instead got Nat</summary>&nbsp;- program '(ref 0) := (succ 0)'</details>

I remain your faithful servant\
